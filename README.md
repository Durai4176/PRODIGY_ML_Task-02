# PRODIGY_ML_Task-02
## Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

### Project Overview
This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
The objective of this task is to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm
and present the results through a simple Streamlit web application.

Customer segmentation helps businesses understand customer behavior by grouping customers with similar characteristics.

---

### Objective
- Perform customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering
- Visualize customer groups in a Streamlit web app
- Understand patterns in customer purchasing behavior

---

### Dataset
- Dataset is loaded using a fixed file path inside the code
- Contains numerical customer-related features
- Only numerical columns are used for clustering

---

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

### Workflow
1. Load dataset from CSV file path
2. Display dataset in Streamlit
3. Select numerical features
4. Handle missing values
5. Apply K-Means clustering
6. Choose number of clusters (K)
7. Assign cluster labels
8. Visualize clusters using scatter plot

---

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Durai4176/PRODIGY_ML_Task-02.git

3. Install required libraries
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit app
   streamlit run app.py

---

### Output
- Clustered customer data
- Visual representation of customer segments
- Clear grouping of customers based on behavior

---

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means
to analyze customer data and extract meaningful insights.
